R2.1: 
Q: Difference b/t an object and a class?
A: A class construct that describes attributes and actions of a group of similar objects that share those attributes and actions. An object is an instance of a class from which it inherits its attributes and actions.

R2.2: 
Q: What is public interface of a class? How is it different from implementation?
A: The public interface of a class are those methods made available for use (i.e. the .println() method of the PrintStream class). Conversely, the private implementation describes the data inside its objects and the instructions for its methods.

R2.3: See Java program in /ch02/R2_03.

R2.4: See Java program in /ch02/R2_04.

R2.5: mystery is declared twice, which isn't allowed.

R2.6:
Q: Explain the difference b/t the '=' symbol in Java and in mathematics.
A: In Java, the '=' symbol assigns a value to a variable. In mathematics, it is a declarative statement noting that two things are equal. It doesn't assign the value, it simply states a fact. It is passive in mathematics and active in Java.

R2.19:
Q: Explain the difference b/t an object and an object reference.
A:
